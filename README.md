### Your Task üìù

For this week's task, you'll be refining your personal portfolio page using CSS. Here are the specific enhancements to implement:

1. **Heading and Paragraph Styles**: Apply appropriate styles to headings and paragraphs to enhance readability and visual appeal. For example, you can experiment with different font sizes, colors, and text alignments.

2. **Backgrounds**: Experiment with background colors or images to add depth and visual interest to your portfolio. You can use CSS properties like `background-color` and `background-image` to achieve this effect.

3. **Typography**: Adjust font sizes and families to ensure a cohesive and professional look across your page. You can use the `font-size` and `font-family` properties to customize the typography.

4. **Layout Refinements**: Utilize margin, padding, and border properties to fine-tune the spacing and alignment of elements for a polished layout. For instance, you can use `margin` to control the space around elements, `padding` to adjust the space inside elements, and `border` for creating visual boundaries.


**Example**:

```css
/* Apply a blue background color to headings */
h1, h2, h3 {
   background-color: #3498db;
   color: #fff;
   padding: 5px;
}

/* Adjust font size for paragraphs */
p {
   font-size: 16px;
}

/* Add a border around images */
img {
   border: 2px solid #ccc;
}
